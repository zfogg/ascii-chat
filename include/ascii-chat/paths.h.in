/**
 * @brief Installation prefix
 *
 * The base installation directory where ascii-chat was installed.
 * The code uses this to construct platform-specific paths for system config and other resources.
 *
 * Default install prefixes:
 * - Linux: "/usr/local" (standard default)
 * - macOS Intel (Homebrew): "/usr/local"
 * - macOS ARM (Homebrew): "/opt/homebrew"
 * - Windows: "C:\\Program Files\\ascii-chat"
 *
 * System config path is constructed as:
 * - Linux/macOS: "${INSTALL_PREFIX}/etc/ascii-chat/config.toml"
 * - Windows: "${INSTALL_PREFIX}\\etc\\ascii-chat\\config.toml"
