Check the README.md and the Makefile to understand this project. You'll learn 
how to build the project and work with the server and client and understand 
what I'm trying to build with this project.

Use the Makefile and `make` to build the project and see if there are any 
compilation errors. Do this when you make changes to the code to confirm that 
the changes compile.

There are two binaries created by this project: bin/client and bin/server. Run 
them with `--help` to confirm that they run without errors after compiling. Be 
sure to `make clean` as you work on the project to ensure we don't have any 
lingering changes in object files from previous builds.

Sometimes you'll want to run the server and client after making changes to see 
if they work as expected or solve the problem I was having.
You can run the server and client with the following commands:
```
./bin/server --color -p 90010 -c 1 &
timeout 3 ./bin/client -p 90010
```
Notice how I use a background process and timeout. This is what I want you to 
do, to simplify your terminal usage experience. The client will run forever if
you connect it to the server so YOU NEED TO RUN IT WITH TIMEOUT. Don't forget
this and run it without timeout.  Make sure to kill the server and client after
running them. You can kill the server and client with the 
collowing commands:
```
pkill -f bin/server
pkill -f bin/client
```
Feel free to create and use server.log and client.log files to help you work 
and test and debug.

Make sure to delete any log files you generate when you're done with them.

Try not to delete files very much. Almost all of the time, I'll be the one to 
delete them, even if you make them.
