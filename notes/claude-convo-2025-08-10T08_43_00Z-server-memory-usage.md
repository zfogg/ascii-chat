  what do you think? does everything look good?

✻ Thinking…

  Looking at the memory reports:

  First report:
  - Total allocated: 1654024722 bytes (~1.65 GB)
  - Total freed: 1646320720 bytes (~1.65 GB)
  - Current usage: 7704002 bytes (~7.7 MB)
  - Peak usage: 11908506 bytes (~11.9 MB)

  Second report (later):
  - Total allocated: 38690619814 bytes (~38.7 GB)
  - Total freed: 38683031276 bytes (~38.7 GB)  
  - Current usage: 7588538 bytes (~7.6 MB)
  - Peak usage: 15242711 bytes (~15.2 MB)

  The good news:
  - Current memory usage is stable (around 7-8 MB)
  - The server is properly freeing memory (freed bytes are very close to allocated)
  - No major memory growth over time

  The concerning parts:
  1. Massive allocation/deallocation churn (38GB allocated/freed) - this suggests we're 
  creating and destroying frames very rapidly
  2. Multiple 1080008 byte allocations (~1MB each) from:
    - network.c:743 (receive_packet allocating packet data)
    - server.c:574 (cached frame copying)
    - ringbuffer.c:369 (framebuffer_write_multi_frame)

  These 1MB allocations are likely frame data. The fact that they show up as "leaked" in the 
  report but the overall memory usage is stable suggests they're being held temporarily (like 
  cached frames) but eventually freed.

  The pattern shows:
  - Each client connection creates some small allocations (packet queues, audio buffers, 
  ringbuffers)
  - Large 1MB allocations are frame data
  - The "leaks" are mostly just active allocations that haven't been freed yet (like cached 
  frames)

  The main issue is the allocation churn - we're allocating and freeing 38GB of memory, which 
  means we're creating/destroying frames very rapidly. 

  Rapid frame creation and destruction could significantly degrade system responsiveness and 
  CPU efficiency. The constant memory allocation and deallocation introduces overhead, 
  potentially causing performance bottlenecks and increased latency in frame processing.

⏺ Looking at these memory reports, I see both good news and some concerns:

  Good News ✅

  - Memory is stable: Current usage stays around 7-8 MB
  - No real leaks: Total freed (38.68 GB) is very close to total allocated (38.69 GB)
  - Peak usage is reasonable: Only 15 MB peak

  Concerns ⚠️

  1. Massive Allocation Churn

  From first to second report, you allocated/freed 37 GB of memory! This means the server is
  creating and destroying frames at an extremely high rate.

  2. Large Frame Allocations

  Multiple 1,080,008 byte (~1 MB) allocations from:
  - network.c:743 - Receiving packet data
  - server.c:574 - Cached frame copying (our new feature!)
  - ringbuffer.c:369 - Writing frames to buffer

  These are frame data allocations. The "leaked" ones are likely just active cached frames that
   haven't been freed yet.

  The Real Issue

  The allocation churn suggests we're creating a new mixed frame for EVERY client on EVERY
  broadcast cycle. With 4 clients at 30 FPS, that's:
  - 4 clients × 30 FPS = 120 frame creations per second
  - Each frame ~1 MB = 120 MB/sec of allocation/deallocation!

  This is inefficient but not a memory leak - just heavy allocation pressure.

  Potential Optimizations

  1. Frame pooling - Reuse frame buffers instead of malloc/free
  2. Smarter caching - Don't recreate frames if nothing changed
  3. Reduce broadcast rate - Maybe 15 FPS is enough?

  The memory system is working correctly (no leaks), but the allocation pattern could be
  optimized for better performance. The cached frames are doing their job preventing flicker,
  but at the cost of more memory operations.
