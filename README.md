==========

ASCII video chat.

Probably the first command line video chat program.

It just prints ASCII, so it works on your rxvt-unicode in OpenBox, a Putty SSH session, and even iTerm or Kitty.app on macOS.  
It even works in an initial UNIX login shell, i.e. the login shell that runs 'startx'.

Eventually it will support 3+ simultaneous people, 'google-hangouts' style, and sound via PulseAudio or something.

Dependencies
==========
- Most people: `apt-get install clang libopencv-dev libjpeg-dev`
- ArchLinux masterrace: `pacman -S clang opencv libjpeg-turbo`
- macOS: `brew install opencv@4 jpeg-turbo`


Build and run
==========
- Clone this repo onto a computer with a webcam.
- Install the dependencies.
- run `make`.
- run `./bin/server -p 90001` in one terminal, and then
- run `./bin/client -p 90001 -a 127.0.0.1` in another.

NOTE: run `./bin/server -h` to see options


TODO
==========
- Client should continuously attempt to reconnect
- Client program should accept URL arguments, as well as IP addresses like it does now
- Colorize ASCII output
- Refactor image processing algorithms
- Client should gracefully handle `frame width > term width`
- Client should gracefully handle `term resize` event
- Rewrite entire thing in Rust!
- Compile to WASM/WASI.

## Usage

Start the server:
```bash
./bin/server [options]
```

Connect with a client:
```bash
./bin/client [options]
```

### New Color Feature

You can now enable colored ASCII output that preserves the original colors from your webcam! Use the `--color` or `-C` flag:

**Server with color:**
```bash
./bin/server --color
```

**Client with color:**
```bash
./bin/client --color
```

The colored output uses ANSI escape codes to colorize each ASCII character based on the RGB values from the original webcam image, creating a much more vibrant and realistic representation.

**Performance Optimizations for Colored Mode:**
- **Color Quantization**: Reduces 16M colors to 512 colors for smaller, more consistent frames
- **Adaptive Frame Rate**: 30 FPS for monochrome, 15 FPS for colored mode  
- **Larger Buffers**: More frame buffering to handle colored frame size variations
- **Optimized Processing**: Reduces frame drops and visual stutter

**Note:** Colored frames are approximately 3x larger than monochrome frames due to the ANSI color codes. The system automatically adjusts the frame buffer size accordingly:
- Monochrome: 64KB frame buffer  
- Colored: 8MB frame buffer (plus 8MB network buffers)

âœ… **Fixed**: Frame buffer and network buffers automatically resize to handle larger colored frames without "Frame too large" errors.

### Options

- `-a --address`: IPv4 address (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `-p --port`: TCP port (default: 90001)  
- `-x --width`: Render width (default: 110, auto-calculated)
- `-y --height`: Render height (default: 70, auto-calculated)
- `-c --webcam-index`: Webcam device index (0-based, server only, default: 0)
- `-f --webcam-flip`: Horizontally flip image (server only, default: 1)
- `-C --color`: Enable colored ASCII output (server and client)
- `-b --background-color`: Enable background colored mode with contrasting text (server only)
- `-h --help`: Show help message
