 * @brief Server Performance Monitoring and Statistics Collection
 *
 * This module implements comprehensive performance monitoring for the ASCII-Chat
 * server, providing real-time insights into system health, resource utilization,
 * and client behavior. It was extracted from the monolithic server.c to provide
 * centralized statistics management.
 *
 * CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:
 * ======================
 * 1. Continuous monitoring of server performance metrics
 * 2. Per-client statistics collection and reporting
 * 3. Buffer pool utilization tracking
 * 4. Packet queue performance analysis
 * 5. Hash table efficiency monitoring
 * 6. Periodic statistics logging for operational visibility
 *
 * MONITORING ARCHITECTURE:
 * ========================
 *
 * STATISTICS COLLECTION THREAD:
 * - Dedicated background thread for non-intrusive monitoring
 * - 30-second reporting intervals (configurable)
 * - Interruptible sleep for responsive shutdown
 * - Thread-safe data collection from all system components
 *
 * PERFORMANCE IMPACT MINIMIZATION:
 * - Read-only access to operational data structures
 * - Minimal locking (reader locks where possible)
 * - Background processing doesn't affect real-time performance
 * - Throttled logging to prevent log spam
 *
 * MONITORED SUBSYSTEMS:
 * =====================
 *
 * CLIENT MANAGEMENT METRICS:
 * - Active client count
 * - Clients with audio capabilities
 * - Clients with video capabilities
 * - Connection duration and activity patterns
 *
 * BUFFER POOL PERFORMANCE:
 * - Global buffer pool utilization
 * - Allocation/deallocation rates
 * - Peak usage patterns
 * - Memory efficiency metrics
 *
 * PACKET QUEUE STATISTICS:
 * - Per-client queue depths
 * - Enqueue/dequeue rates
 * - Packet drop rates under load
 * - Queue overflow incidents
 *
 * HASH TABLE EFFICIENCY:
 * - Client lookup performance
 * - Hash collision rates
 * - Load factor monitoring
 * - Access pattern analysis
 *
 * FRAME PROCESSING METRICS:
 * - Total frames captured
 * - Total frames sent to clients
 * - Frame drop rate under load
 * - Blank frame count (no video sources)
 *
 * THREAD SAFETY AND DATA CONSISTENCY:
 * ====================================
 *
 * NON-INTRUSIVE MONITORING:
 * - Uses reader locks to avoid blocking operational threads
 * - Takes atomic snapshots of volatile data
 * - Minimal impact on render thread performance
 * - Safe concurrent access to client data
 *
 * STATISTICS ATOMICITY:
 * - Global statistics protected by dedicated mutex
 * - Consistent reporting even during concurrent updates
 * - Thread-safe access to shared counters
 *
 * OPERATIONAL INTEGRATION:
 * ========================
 *
 * LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT:
 * - Statistics thread started in main.c during server initialization
 * - Graceful shutdown coordination with other threads
 * - Clean resource cleanup on server termination
 *
 * DEBUGGING SUPPORT:
 * - Extensive debug logging for troubleshooting
 * - Performance bottleneck identification
 * - System health monitoring
 * - Operational visibility for administrators
 *
 * EXTENSIBILITY FRAMEWORK:
 * ========================
 *
 * METRIC ADDITION:
 * - Easy addition of new performance counters
 * - Modular statistics collection
 * - Configurable reporting intervals
 * - Custom metric aggregation
 *
 * INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * - client.c: Client lifecycle statistics
 * - render.c: Frame processing metrics
 * - buffer_pool.c: Memory utilization data
 * - packet_queue.c: Queue performance data
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULAR DESIGN:
 * =========================
 * The original server.c had no centralized monitoring, making it impossible to:
 * - Understand system performance characteristics
 * - Debug performance issues under load
 * - Monitor resource utilization
 * - Track client behavior patterns
 *
 * This separation provides:
 * - Centralized performance visibility
 * - Non-intrusive monitoring infrastructure
 * - Operational debugging capabilities
 * - System health awareness
 *
 * PERFORMANCE PHILOSOPHY:
 * ========================
 * - Monitoring should never impact real-time performance
 * - Statistics collection uses minimal CPU overhead
 * - Background processing model
 * - Graceful degradation under extreme load

 */

/**
 * @brief Main statistics collection and reporting thread function
 *
 * This background thread performs continuous monitoring of server performance
 * and logs comprehensive statistics reports at regular intervals. It operates
 * independently of the main server processing threads to avoid performance impact.
 *
 * THREAD EXECUTION FLOW:
 * ======================
 *
 * 1. INITIALIZATION:
 *    - Log thread startup (with debug instrumentation)
 *    - Initialize loop counters for debugging
 *    - Set up monitoring infrastructure
 *
 * 2. MAIN MONITORING LOOP:
 *    - Check shutdown flag frequently (every 10ms)
 *    - Sleep in small intervals to maintain responsiveness
 *    - Collect statistics from all system components every 30 seconds
 *    - Generate comprehensive performance reports
 *
 * 3. STATISTICS COLLECTION:
 *    - Global buffer pool utilization
 *    - Per-client connection and activity status
 *    - Packet queue performance metrics
 *    - Hash table efficiency statistics
 *    - Frame processing counters
 *
 * 4. CLEANUP AND EXIT:
 *    - Detect shutdown signal and exit loop gracefully
 *    - Log thread termination for debugging
 *    - Return NULL to indicate clean exit
 *
 * MONITORING METHODOLOGY:
 * =======================
 *
 * NON-BLOCKING DATA COLLECTION:
 * - Uses reader locks on shared data structures
 * - Takes atomic snapshots of volatile counters
 * - Minimal impact on operational performance
 * - Safe concurrent access with render threads
 *
 * RESPONSIVE SHUTDOWN:
 * - Checks g_should_exit every 10ms during sleep periods
 * - Exits monitoring loop immediately when shutdown detected
 * - No hanging or delayed shutdown behavior
 * - Clean resource cleanup
 *
 * PERFORMANCE METRICS COLLECTED:
 * ==============================
 *
 * CLIENT STATISTICS:
 * - Total active clients
 * - Clients with audio queues active
 * - Clients with video queues active
 * - Per-client connection duration
 *
 * BUFFER POOL METRICS:
 * - Global allocation/deallocation rates
 * - Peak memory usage patterns
 * - Buffer pool efficiency
 * - Memory fragmentation indicators
 *
 * PACKET QUEUE PERFORMANCE:
 * - Per-client enqueue/dequeue rates
 * - Packet drop incidents
 * - Queue depth histograms
 * - Overflow frequency analysis
 *
 * HASH TABLE EFFICIENCY:
 * - Client lookup performance
 * - Hash collision statistics
 * - Load balancing effectiveness
 * - Access pattern analysis
 *
 * DEBUGGING AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
 * ===============================
 *
 * EXTENSIVE DEBUG LOGGING:
 * The function contains detailed debug printf statements for troubleshooting
 * threading issues. This instrumentation helps diagnose:
 * - Thread startup/shutdown problems
 * - Shutdown detection timing issues
 * - Sleep/wake cycle behavior
 * - Statistics collection reliability
 *
 * DEBUG OUTPUT INCLUDES:
 * - Function entry/exit points
 * - Loop iteration counts
 * - Shutdown flag state changes
 * - Sleep cycle progression
 * - Statistics collection timing
 *
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 * ===============
 * - Graceful handling of data access failures
 * - Continued operation if individual metrics fail
 * - No fatal errors that would crash statistics thread
 * - Degraded reporting if subsystems unavailable
 *
 * PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 * ===========================
 * - 30-second reporting interval balances visibility vs overhead
 * - 10ms sleep granularity provides responsive shutdown
 * - Read-only access minimizes lock contention
 * - Background processing doesn't affect real-time performance
 *
 * @param arg Thread argument (unused - required by thread interface)
 * @return NULL on clean thread termination
 *
 * @note This function runs continuously until server shutdown
 * @note Debug printf statements help diagnose threading issues
 * @note All statistics collection is non-blocking and read-only
 *
 * @warning Thread must be properly joined to prevent resource leaks
