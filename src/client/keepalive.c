/**
 * @file keepalive.c
 * @brief ASCII-Chat Client Connection Keepalive Management
 *
 * This module implements connection keepalive functionality for the ASCII-Chat
 * client, ensuring reliable detection of connection failures through periodic
 * ping/pong exchanges with the server.
 *
 * ## Keepalive Architecture
 *
 * The keepalive system uses a dedicated ping thread:
 * - **Ping Thread**: Sends periodic ping packets to server
 * - **Response Monitoring**: Server responds with pong packets
 * - **Timeout Detection**: Connection loss detected via failed pings
 * - **Coordinated Shutdown**: Thread integrates with global shutdown logic
 *
 * ## Timing Strategy
 *
 * Keepalive timing optimized for connection reliability:
 * - **Ping Interval**: 3 seconds between ping packets
 * - **Server Timeout**: Server times out clients after 5 seconds of silence
 * - **Safety Margin**: 2-second buffer prevents false disconnections
 * - **Network Tolerance**: Accounts for network jitter and processing delays
 *
 * ## Thread Management
 *
 * Ping thread follows robust lifecycle management:
 * - **Creation**: Thread started after successful connection
 * - **Monitoring**: Continuous health checks and connection validation
 * - **Coordination**: Respects global shutdown flags and connection state
 * - **Termination**: Graceful shutdown with resource cleanup
 * - **Recovery**: Thread recreated for each new connection
 *
 * ## Connection Health Monitoring
 *
 * Multiple layers of connection health detection:
 * 1. **Socket Validity**: Check socket file descriptor before sending
 * 2. **Connection Flags**: Monitor atomic connection state variables
 * 3. **Send Failures**: Detect network errors during ping transmission
 * 4. **Global Shutdown**: Respect application-wide shutdown requests
 *
 * ## Integration Points
 *
 * - **main.c**: Keepalive thread lifecycle management
 * - **server.c**: Ping packet transmission and connection monitoring
 * - **protocol.c**: Pong packet reception and response handling
 * - **network.c**: Low-level ping/pong packet formatting
 *
 * ## Error Handling
 *
 * Keepalive errors handled with appropriate escalation:
 * - **Ping Send Failures**: Signal connection loss for reconnection
 * - **Socket Errors**: Clean thread exit and connection cleanup
 * - **Network Timeouts**: Graceful handling without false alarms
 * - **Thread Failures**: Log errors and continue with degraded monitoring
 *
 * ## Resource Management
 *
 * Minimal resource usage for efficient keepalive:
 * - **Thread Resources**: Single lightweight thread with minimal stack
 * - **Network Overhead**: Small ping/pong packets with minimal bandwidth
 * - **Timing Precision**: Efficient sleep implementation with early wake
 * - **Memory Usage**: No dynamic allocations in steady-state operation
