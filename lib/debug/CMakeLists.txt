# Debug Module
# =============================================================================
# Debug utilities for development builds only.
# Sources are included in ascii-chat-core when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE != Release
#
# This directory doesn't create its own target - files are included
# directly in the core module for non-release builds.
# =============================================================================

# Debug sources are added to CORE_SRCS in lib/CMakeLists.txt
# This file exists for organizational purposes and potential future expansion
