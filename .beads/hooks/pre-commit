# Delegates to 'bd hook pre-commit' which contains the actual hook logic.
# This pattern ensures hook behavior is always in sync with the installed
# bd version — no manual updates needed.
#
# The 'bd hook' command supports:
# - Per-worktree export state tracking
# - Dolt in-process export (no lock deadlocks)
# - Sync-branch routing
# - Hook chaining configuration

# Check if bd is available
