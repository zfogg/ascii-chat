#
# bd (beads) post-checkout hook - thin shim
#
# This shim delegates to 'bd hook post-checkout' which contains
# the actual hook logic. This pattern ensures hook behavior is always
# in sync with the installed bd version - no manual updates needed.
#
# The 'bd hook' command (singular) supports:
# - Guard against frequent firing (only imports if JSONL changed)
# - Per-worktree state tracking
# - Dolt branch-then-merge pattern
# - Hook chaining configuration

# Check if bd is available
if ! command -v bd >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # Silently skip - post-checkout is called frequently
    exit 0
