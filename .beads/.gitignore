# NOTE: Do NOT add negation patterns (e.g., !issues.jsonl) here.
# They would override fork protection in .git/info/exclude, allowing
# contributors to accidentally commit upstream issue databases.
# The JSONL files (issues.jsonl, interactions.jsonl) and config files
# are tracked by git by default since no pattern above ignores them.
